# AL05 = (alias t never used in statement) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/flattening-arrays.html
# LT01 = Line ending, already catered for by precommit hook
# ST06 = Select wildcards then simple targets before calculations and aggregates.
# ST07 = Found USING statement. Expecting only ON statements. (enforcing this introduces amniguity in existing products)
# RF01 = Works on compiled targets, issue with dbt templates
# RF02 = References are not being picked up by templater properly
# RF03 = Select which is inconsistent with previous references.
# RF04 = Keywords must not be used, already heavily integrated in models
# TODO: ST06 is a good rule, but may interfere with existing data products, create separate item to test and confirm there is no impact
# TODO: Upgrade sqlfluff after dbt upgrades are done, templater may have improved allowing some of the above rules to be included again
